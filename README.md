# Deep-Learning-Architectures

This repository contains code for implementation of various Deep Learning Architectures using Keras alongwith implementation of FineTuning and Transfer Learning Experiments on pretrained VGGNet model. The summaries for each architecture and key takeaways from the corresponding papers are also included for reference.
