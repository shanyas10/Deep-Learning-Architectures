# Deep-Learning-Architectures

This repository contains code for implementation of various Deep Learning Architectures using Keras along with implementation of [FineTuning and Transfer Learning Experiments on pretrained VGGNet model](https://github.com/thechange/Deep-Learning-Architectures/tree/master/VGGNet%20Implementation). The summaries for each architecture and key takeaways from the corresponding papers are also included for reference.

Note that I don't focus on training the models here. So I have written the code for training [AlexNet](https://github.com/thechange/Deep-Learning-Architectures/tree/master/AlexNet%20Implementation) and other models can be trained similarly. The aim of this repository is to understand the difference between the architectures, the parameters to be trained, the complexity of implementation and understand how they can be implemented using [Keras](http://keras.io).
